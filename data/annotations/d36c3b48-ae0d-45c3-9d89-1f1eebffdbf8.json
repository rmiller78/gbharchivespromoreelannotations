Cronin, the City Welfare Director to discuss their grievances. The following day, as spectators and supporters gathered outside the building, the Boston Police Department forcefully removed the demonstrators and dispersed the crowd. Amid accusations of police brutality, a riot erupted in the Roxbury area of Grove Hall lasting three days. This short video (no sound) shows a few photographs taken of the riot on Blue Hill Avenue and its aftermath. The video zooms in and out of approximately six different photographs that were taken by staff of the Boston Herald, one of Boston's daily newspapers. The shots include: (1) Three helmeted, White Boston police officers carrying a Black man by his arms and legs, with other officers in the background; (2) Rubbish strewn about the street, people running into stores, including two men leaving a store with large boxes; (3) A sign in front of a cement finishing company that states: \"Caution! Please, I am your Soul Brother, Ruben Johnson;\" (4) Boston Police officers, in riot gear and displaying firearms, walking along Blue Hill Avenue; (5) A man (possibly a police detective) inside a shoe store in which there are boxes and merchandise strewn about; and (6) another man inside a store, showing boxes and merchandise strewn around the store."

Jones reports that Robert Kennedy (Mayor of Lowell) called on supporters of school desegregation to show support by riding buses with students in Lowell today. Jones' report includes footage of Kennedy addressing supporters, including Evelyn Murphy (Lieutenant governor of Massachusetts), Luis Tiant (former Red Sox pitcher) and Grace Corrigan (mother of astronaut Christa McAuliffe). Jones reports that George Kouloheras (Lowell School Committee) is a leader of the anti-busing movement in Lowell. Jones reports that Kuoloheras is campaigning to elect anti-busing candidates to the Lowell School Committee in order to overturn the present school desegregation plan. Jones interviews Kouloheras. Kouloheras says that he hopes that new school committee will reject busing and find another way to integrate schools. Jones also interviews Michael Kennedy (Regional Manager, National School Bus Service, Inc.) and Donna Senior (Lowell parent) about the bus routes in Lowell. Jones notes that the coming elections will decide how school desegregation is implemented in Lowell. Jones' report is accompanied by footage of students and school buses in Lowell. This tape includes additional footage of school buses on the streets in Lowell."
