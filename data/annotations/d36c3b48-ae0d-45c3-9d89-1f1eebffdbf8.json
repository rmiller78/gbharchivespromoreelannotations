Cronin, the City Welfare Director to discuss their grievances. The following day, as spectators and supporters gathered outside the building, the Boston Police Department forcefully removed the demonstrators and dispersed the crowd. Amid accusations of police brutality, a riot erupted in the Roxbury area of Grove Hall lasting three days. This short video (no sound) shows a few photographs taken of the riot on Blue Hill Avenue and its aftermath. The video zooms in and out of approximately six different photographs that were taken by staff of the Boston Herald, one of Boston's daily newspapers. The shots include: (1) Three helmeted, White Boston police officers carrying a Black man by his arms and legs, with other officers in the background; (2) Rubbish strewn about the street, people running into stores, including two men leaving a store with large boxes; (3) A sign in front of a cement finishing company that states: \"Caution! Please, I am your Soul Brother, Ruben Johnson;\" (4) Boston Police officers, in riot gear and displaying firearms, walking along Blue Hill Avenue; (5) A man (possibly a police detective) inside a shoe store in which there are boxes and merchandise strewn about; and (6) another man inside a store, showing boxes and merchandise strewn around the store."
